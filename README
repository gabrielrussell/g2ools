			 g2ools - Nord Modular G2 Tools

What is it?

g2ools is a set of python applications and libraries to handle the Nord
Modular G2 synthesizer.  It allows a person to write simple tools to process
G2 .pch2 patch files as well as .prf2 performance files.  Python was chosen
because of the authors knowledge of the langauge and portability.  The main
application written was nm2g2 Nord Modular (nm1) to G2 patch converter.  The
first version took 3 weeks from start to finish.  After the initial release,
3phase provided main models of the various modules available within the nm1
as they are quite different or missing from the Nord Modular G2.  It works
on many patches, but there are patches that will not work after the converted
patch is loaded into the G2.  3phase and I have made every attempt to do the
best convertion possible.

This software is released under the GPL licence and comes complete with
source code to the applications and libraries.

nm2g2.py

  nm2g2.py is a converter from Clavia's original Nord Modular (nm1) patch file
to the Nord Modular G2 (g2) patch file.  It can convert whole directories and
currently is used to converter the Nord Modular Patch Collection consisting
of almost 30000 patches.  Many patches work and some do not.  You're success
will vary depending on the complexity of the original patch and the
differences between the two synthesizers.
